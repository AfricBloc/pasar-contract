PasarAdmin Smart Contract

Overview

PasarAdmin.sol is a governance smart contract designed for the Pasar protocol, built on Ethereum. It extends OpenZeppelin's TimelockController to manage upgrades for multiple proxy contracts and implements a custom role management system with a 2-day timelock. The contract integrates Chainlink Automation for automated upgrade execution, includes reentrancy protection, and supports pausability for emergency control. It is written in Solidity ^0.8.24 and is intended for secure, transparent, and decentralized protocol administration.
Key Features

Multi-Contract Upgrade Queuing: Schedules and executes upgrades for multiple proxy contracts with a 2-day timelock, supporting both manual and automated execution via Chainlink Automation.
Custom Role Management: Manages roles (ADMIN_ROLE and DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) with a timelocked process for granting or revoking permissions, including cancellation functionality.
Security Mechanisms: Incorporates reentrancy protection (ReentrancyGuard), pausability (Pausable), and role-based access control to ensure secure operations.
Chainlink Automation: Uses Chainlink Keepers to automatically execute upgrades when their timelock expires, with a 1-hour cooldown between executions.
Auditability: Emits detailed events for upgrades, role changes, and automation activities, enabling transparent monitoring.

Functionality
Upgrade Management

Scheduling Upgrades:
scheduleUpgrade(address target, address newImplementation): Schedules a proxy upgrade with a 2-day timelock, restricted to ADMIN_ROLE. Stores details in pendingUpgrades and adds target to upgradeQueue.


Canceling Upgrades:
cancelUpgrade(address target): Cancels a pending upgrade, removes it from pendingUpgrades and upgradeQueue, restricted to ADMIN_ROLE.


Executing Upgrades:
performUpgrade(address target): Manually executes a pending upgrade after the timelock, restricted to ADMIN_ROLE.
performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData): Automatically executes a pending upgrade via Chainlink Keeper, with a 1-hour cooldown.
_performUpgrade(address target, bool isAutomated): Internal function handling upgrade logic, including low-level calls to the proxyâ€™s upgradeTo function.


Monitoring:
getUpgradeQueue(): Returns the list of proxy addresses with pending upgrades.
checkUpkeep(bytes calldata): Checks if any upgrade is ready for automated execution, returning the target address.



Role Management

Scheduling Role Changes:
scheduleRoleChange(address account, bytes32 role, bool grant): Schedules a role grant or revoke with a 2-day timelock, restricted to DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE. Generates a unique operationId using keccak256 and stores details in pendingRoleChanges.


Executing Role Changes:
executeRoleChange(bytes32 operationId): Executes a pending role change after the timelock, calling _grantRole or _revokeRole, restricted to DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.


Canceling Role Changes:
cancelRoleChange(bytes32 operationId): Cancels a pending role change, clearing it from pendingRoleChanges, restricted to DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.


Checking Readiness:
isRoleChangeReady(bytes32 operationId): Returns whether a role change is ready to execute based on its timelock.



Security Features

Access Control: Uses onlyRole(ADMIN_ROLE) for upgrades and onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) for role management and pausing.
Timelock: Enforces a 2-day delay (MIN_DELAY) for upgrades and role changes to allow community review.
Pausability: pause() and unpause() (restricted to DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) halt or resume operations in emergencies.
Reentrancy Protection: nonReentrant modifier prevents reentrancy attacks during upgrade and role change execution.
Chainlink Keeper Restriction: onlyChainlinkKeeper modifier ensures only the designated keeper can call performUpkeep.
Cooldown: UPKEEP_COOLDOWN (1 hour) prevents excessive automated executions.

Deployment
Prerequisites

Solidity Compiler: solc version 0.8.24 or compatible.
Dependencies: Install OpenZeppelin (@openzeppelin/contracts) and Chainlink (@chainlink/contracts) via npm or download from their respective repositories.npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @chainlink/contracts


Ethereum Network: Deploy on a mainnet or testnet (e.g., Sepolia, Goerli) with access to Chainlink Keepers.
Chainlink Keeper: Register the contract with Chainlink Automation and obtain the keeper address.

Deployment Steps

Prepare Constructor Parameters:
proposers: Array of addresses allowed to propose timelocked operations (for TimelockController upgrades).
executors: Array of addresses allowed to execute timelocked operations (for TimelockController upgrades).
admin: Address to receive ADMIN_ROLE and DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE.

Compile the Contract:npx hardhat compile

Ensure hardhat.config.js specifies Solidity 0.8.24 and includes OpenZeppelin and Chainlink dependencies.
Deploy the Contract:Use a deployment script (e.g., with Hardhat):const PasarAdmin = await ethers.getContractFactory("PasarAdmin");
const pasarAdmin = await PasarAdmin.deploy(
    proposers, // e.g., ["0x..."]
    executors, // e.g., ["0x..."]
    admin,     // e.g., "0x..."
    chainlinkKeeper // e.g., "0x..."
);
await pasarAdmin.deployed();
console.log("PasarAdmin deployed to:", pasarAdmin.address);


Register with Chainlink Keepers:
Register the contract on Chainlink Automation with the checkUpkeep and performUpkeep functions.
Set the upkeep interval and gas limit as needed (e.g., check every 1 hour).


Verify the Contract:Verify on Etherscan or similar block explorer:npx hardhat verify --network <network> <contract-address> <constructor-args>



Configuration

Timelock: MIN_DELAY is set to 2 days (172800 seconds) and is immutable. Adjust in the source code if a different timelock is needed before deployment.
Cooldown: UPKEEP_COOLDOWN is set to 1 hour (3600 seconds) and is immutable. Modify in the source code if needed.
Roles: Ensure the admin address is secure (e.g., a multisig wallet) to prevent unauthorized role changes or pausing.

Example Test (Hardhat)
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("PasarAdmin", function () {
  let PasarAdmin, pasarAdmin, admin, keeper, proposer, executor, proxy;
  beforeEach(async function () {
    [admin, keeper, proposer, executor] = await ethers.getSigners();
    PasarAdmin = await ethers.getContractFactory("PasarAdmin");
    pasarAdmin = await PasarAdmin.deploy(
      [proposer.address],
      [executor.address],
      admin.address,
      keeper.address

  it("should schedule and execute a role change", async function () {

    const operationId = ethers.utils.keccak256(
      ethers.utils.defaultAbiCoder.encode(
        ["address", "bytes32", "bool", "uint256"],
        [proposer.address, role, true, await ethers.provider.getBlock("latest").timestamp]
      )
    );

    await pasarAdmin.connect(admin).scheduleRoleChange(proposer.address, role, true);
    await ethers.provider.send("evm_increaseTime", [2 * 24 * 60 * 60]); // Advance 2 days
    await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine");

    await expect(pasarAdmin.connect(admin).executeRoleChange(operationId))
      .to.emit(pasarAdmin, "RoleChangeExecuted")
      .withArgs(proposer.address, role, true);

    expect(await pasarAdmin.hasRole(role, proposer.address)).to.be.true;
  });
});

Security Considerations

Timelock: The 2-day MIN_DELAY ensures transparency for upgrades and role changes. Do not reduce without governance consensus.
Access Control: Secure the admin address (use a multisig like Gnosis Safe). Loss of DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE could lock critical functions.
Reentrancy: nonReentrant protects upgrade and role change execution, but test thoroughly with complex proxy contracts.
Chainlink Keeper: Ensure the chainlinkKeeper address is correct and registered with Chainlink Automation. Incorrect setup could halt automated upgrades.
Pausability: Use pause only in emergencies, as it halts all operations. Test unpause scenarios to ensure smooth recovery.
Operation ID Uniqueness: The keccak256(abi.encode(account, role, grant, block.timestamp)) ensures unique operationIds for role changes, but avoid scheduling identical role changes in the same block.

Scalability Considerations

Upgrade Queue: The upgradeQueue array is gas-efficient for small to medium queues but may become costly for large queues. Consider a doubly-linked list for high-throughput scenarios.
Role Changes: The pendingRoleChanges mapping is efficient for storage but lacks a queue for automation. Add a role change queue and integrate with checkUpkeep/performUpkeep for automated execution if needed.
Gas Costs: Upgrade execution involves low-level calls, and role changes involve storage updates. Monitor gas costs during testing and optimize if deploying on high-gas networks.

Future Enhancements

Automated Role Changes: Extend checkUpkeep and performUpkeep to process pendingRoleChanges for automated role change execution.
Monitoring Functions: Add getPendingRoleChanges to list all pending role changes, similar to getUpgradeQueue.
Duplicate Prevention: Add checks in scheduleRoleChange to prevent scheduling duplicate role changes for the same account and role.
Configurable Timelocks: Allow governance to adjust MIN_DELAY or UPKEEP_COOLDOWN via timelocked proposals.
